```
name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name
```

The local variable 'name' is initialized and assigned to the string object 'Bob'.

The local variable 'save_name' is intialized and assigned to the local variable 'name' which points to the same string object 'Bob'.

The .upcase! method is invoked and called by the local variable 'name'. As the method is permanately destrcutive it mutates the string object and captializes it. 'Bob' is now 'BOB'.

The puts method is then involved and the local variables 'name' and 'save_name' are called. As both local variables are assigned indirectly to the same object, the puts method prints: "BOB" "BOB". The puts method then returns nil.
