The Rules:
The objective of twenty one is to get the highest collective value of
cards without going over the number of twenty one.\n

Jack, Queen and King are equal to 10 and Ace can be either 1 or 11.\n

You, and the dealer, will be dealt 2 cards at the start of the round.
You can either 'stick' with your current total or 'hit' to add another
card.\n

Once you 'stick' you cannot add another card. It's then the dealers
turn to stick or hit.\n

If your total goes over 21, you 'bust' and lose the game.\n

Once both players have stuck with their hands,both sides reveal their cards.\n

The highest total is the round winner. The first to 5 rounds is the GRANDWINNER.
