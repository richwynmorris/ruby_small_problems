# Question 1

# Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

    true  # => Object 
    "hello" # => Object
    [1, 2, 3, "happy days"] #=> Object
    142 #=> Object 

  # You can find out what class the object is by calling the #class method.
