# The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

# Now your task is to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.
# Input/Output

#     [input] integer year

#     1000 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 9000

#     [output] an integer

#     the minimum year number that is strictly larger than the input number year and all its digits are distinct.

  loop do
    year += 1
    break if year.digits.reverse == year.digits.reverse.uniq
  end
