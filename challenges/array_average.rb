=begin
  
Write a method that takes one argument, an array containing integers,
and returns the average of all numbers in the array. The array will 
never be empty and the numbers will always be positive integers.

Examples:

puts average([1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8]) == 25
puts average([9, 47, 23, 95, 16, 52]) == 40

The tests above should print true.
  
=end

def average(arr)

  arr.sum / arr.length

end

puts average([1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8]) == 25
puts average([9, 47, 23, 95, 16, 52]) == 40
