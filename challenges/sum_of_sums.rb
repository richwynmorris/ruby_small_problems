# Sum of Sums

# Write a method that takes an Array of numbers and then returns the 
# sum of the sums of each leading subsequence for that Array. You 
# may assume that the Array always contains at least one number.
  
# Examples:

# sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
# sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
# sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
# sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35

def sum_of_sums(array)

  answer = 0

  array.each_with_index do |num, index|
    answer += array.slice(0..index).sum
  end
