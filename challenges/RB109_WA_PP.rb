# What is the code output? What does it return? What does this show about #delete and #delete_at?


numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

p numbers.delete_at(1)

p numbers.delete(1)

# On line 3, the method `p` is invoked and takes numbers as an argument.
# The variable numbers, on this line, has also called the .delete_at method
# which takes one arguement, the integer 1. 

# The .delete_at method iterates over array and selects the value at index position 1.
# This returns the integer 2 and mutates the array to [1,3,4,5].

# The return value 2 is passed to the p method as an arguement and p returns the value 2

# On line 5, the method 'p' is invoked and takes numbers as an arguement with the .delete 
# method invoked upon it. .delete also takes an argument which is the integer 1. 

# The .delete method iterates over the array and selects the value that is is equal to the
# argument that is passed to it. It then returns that object, in this case 1, 
# and deletes the object from the array thereby mutating it. 

# The p method on line 5 returns the value of 1 as this is the return value of the method .delete 

# This shows that the delete_at method, mutates an object based on the index position
# that is passed as a argument. Whereas, the .delete method mutates the object by removing
# the element that matches the arguement passed to it. Both of these methods return the deleted 
# value

x = "Bob"

​
3.times do |x|

  x = "Alice"

  puts x

end

​

puts x

```

# ​On line 1, x is intialized as a variable and is assigned the value of the string object 'Bob'

# On line 3, the method times is called by the integer 3 and a do and end block is passed to it 
# as an argument

# The block has the parameter |x|, the parameter x is then assigned the value of the string object  
# 'Alice'.

# Within the block the puts method is invoked and the variable x is passed to it as an arguement.

# This will output 'Alice' 3 times and return nil as part of the times method. 

# The puts method is invoked on the last line and it passes x to it as an argument. This 
# prints the value assigned to x which is 'Bob' and returns nil.

# It does this as this is an example of variable shadowing. The parameter x is named the same 
# as the variable x in the outerscope and as a result it creates a new object in innerscope but
# this does not affect x in the outerscope.

def fix(value)

  value.upcase!

  value.concat('!')

end

​

s = 'hello'

fix(s)

puts s

```

# On lines 1-7, the method fix is defined with one parameter, value. 

# On line 9, the variable s is initalized and assigned the value of the string object 'hello'

# on line 11, the fix method is invoked and s is passed to it as an arguement.

# On line 3, the paramter value calls the .upcase! method which mutates the string value
# to uppercase letters. 'HELLO'

# On line 5, the parameter value calls the .concat method which takes one arguement, the 
# string object '!'. This again mutates the string object and the string object '!' is added 
# to the end of the string 'HELLO', transforming the value of value to 'HELLO!'

# As s and value are pointing to the same object, s's value is also 'HELLO!'

# On line 13, the puts method is invoked and the variable s is passed to it as an argument. 

# This outputs the string object 'HELLO!' and returns nil. 

# This is an example of mutation and how Ruby works as pass by reference when invoking mutative methods.
