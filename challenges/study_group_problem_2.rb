# a is intialized as a local variable and assigned the integer 5 as its value.

# On lines 3 - 5 the method display is defined to take one parameter, n.

# On line 9 we invoke the method display and pass the variable a to it as an arguement.

# On line 5 the puts method is invoked and passes in the local variable n.

# n within the method is referencing the argument a and it's value, the integer 5.

# The puts method prints the integer 5 to the console and returns nil.
